# Gathering-Covid-19-Data
### Gathering case data for Covid-19, changing formats and acquiring new attributes.

### Acknowledgements

###### Most of the data in this repo comes from "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University", link to the repo is https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 

###### Data of France come from "Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé" (Ministry of Health in France).

### Contents
###### In this repo, you will find a csv file that contains 

       ['Country', 'Date', 'Confirmed', 'Recovered', 'Deaths', 'Active Cases',
       'Death Rate(%)', 'Increase', 'FirstDays', 'day_xth', 'Population_1k',
       'TenCase', 'Cases/1000s']

###### which shows country names, date of the day, cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases, cumulative deaths, active cases, death rate in percentage, daily increase of the confirmed cases, the day that countries confirmed their first case(s), day count of the countries starting from the 'FirstDays', population in thousands, the day that countries confirmed at least ten cases for the first time, cumulative cases per one thousand people.

###### Also a jupyter notebook that shows the process of data from sources to the final dataset in the repo.

### Motivation of the study
###### I needed to create a Covid-19 dataset for my Design Project in my university. For many reasons, I've faced a lot of problems during the process. After I've finished it; I've decided to put all of the data collection part to Python, for creating something that I can easily update and solving the problems that challenged me the most. I've tried to show the causes behind the most of the process in the notebook.
